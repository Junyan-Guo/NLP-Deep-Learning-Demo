## Key differences between text processing in English and Chinese text data:

  - Segmentation:
  
    **Chinese**: "世界你好" -> "世界", "你好"
    
    **English**: "Hello World" -> "Hello", "World"
    
  - Lemmatization:
    More for **Text Minning**, **NLP** for better understanding and analysis of the text.
    
    **English**: "did", "done", "doing", "does" -> "do"
    
                 "potatoes" -> "potato"
                 
                 "cities" -> "city"
                 
                 "children -> "child"
                 
  - Stemming:
    The word output after stemming may be meaningless.
    
    More for **Information Retrieval**.
    
    **English**: "hourse" -> "hors"
    
                 "writing" -> "write" / "writ"
